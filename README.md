# pandas-and-bananas

![screenshot](screenshots/screenshot.png)

Color game for Pebble SDK ~~3.0~~ 4.97 that sees the user controlling a panda via
accelerometer tilting or buttons to catch fruit and avoid bombs.

This is a small fork from the original repo, changing the code to be
buildable with the latest (as of early 2026) Pebble dev tools.
